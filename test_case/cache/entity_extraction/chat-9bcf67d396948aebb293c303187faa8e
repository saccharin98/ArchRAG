People \nare saying that Harry is introducing bad things and encouraging bad things. But it seems \nto me that these things were already here. My god why don't you people listen? He's \ntrying to tell you something is wrong with this school. Half the people that are here are on \na probation of some kind. We are all really scared to be who we really are. I am not \nperfect. I've just been going through the motions of being perfect, and inside I'm \nscreaming.\n\nCreswood - Paige, you were a model student.\n\n<Paige walks out were the press await>\n\nReporter #2 - Do you know who he is? Are you prepared to do anything he says?\n\nPaige - <Shouting into the camera> Can you hear me? Don't listen to them, don't listen to \nany of them, stay on, stay hard!\n\nReporter #2 - Are you on drugs?\n\nPaige - Arrrgh. Talk Hard. Arrrrrgh.\n\nMark - I've got a lot of homework I'm gonna take off alright.\n\nMarla - Mark I know why your really going home. It's because you wanna listen to that \nshow tonight don't you?\n\n<Play Peter Murphy>\n\n<Nora goes to Marks house where she finds him burning his Happy Harry Hardon \nletters>\n\nNora - Hi! What are you doing? You having fun?\n\nMark - Yeah.\n\nNora - Hey, look I took some of these off the wall for you. I mistakingly thought you \nmight want them.\n\nMark - Thanks.\n\nNora - So I guess you're not going on tonight.\n\nMark - Brilliant.\n\nNora - Is this all just a game to you. You know you can't just shout fire in a theatre and \nwalk out. You have a responsibility for the people who believe in you. What is this? \nC'mon say something, say anything. Open your mouth and say get the hell out of here \nbitch.\n\nMark - I can't.\n\nNora - You can't what?\n\nMark - I can't talk.\n\nNora - Sure you can talk.\n\nMark - I can't talk to you.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - I got a letter from this guy who's got a problem, he can't talk. I \nmean he can talk, but never when he wants to, not to girls, not to people.\n\nBrian - I can't believe it's as bad as they say.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - He just opened up his mouth and nothing came out. And this jerk \nfinds somebody that he likes, which is probably the worst thing to happen to a person \nwho can't talk. So I don't know what to tell this guy because lately every time I give out \nadvice the fit hits the shan. So I don't know, maybe the best thing to do is just turn around \nand face the music and try to talk.\n\nMarla - Mark!\n\nMark - Coming.\n\nMarla - Mark it's just us.

Hi I'm Nora Diniro.\n\nMarla - Nice to meet you, how do you do.\n\nNora - I was afraid you would be mad at me for disturbing Mark's homework.\n\nMarla - You don't know how happy we are to meet you.\n\nNora - Listen I got to go, but it was really nice to have met you, bye Mark.\n\nMarla - No, you don't have to go.
