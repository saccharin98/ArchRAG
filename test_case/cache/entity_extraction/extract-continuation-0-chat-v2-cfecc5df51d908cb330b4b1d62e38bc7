You have driven a jeep before right?\n\n<Concrete Blondie plays and the F.C.C. vans go on the search of Happy Harry Hardon>\n\nMr. Watts - Personally I hope we get to hear from him a little bit before they nab him it \nwill be interesting to see how hard he is then.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - Hello Dad we're going to jail.\n\nNora - Say hi to Mom.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - Hi folks! It seems we have a new listener tonight. Mr Watts of the \nF.C.C. Hi Arthur thanks for coming out.\n\nWatts - Well thank you for coming out.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - Imagine a fucking political hag being in charge of free speech in \nAmerica. I bet Watts was the guy who took names at high school when the teacher was \nabsent.\n\nWatts - This is the problem with free speech. Would you cut that thing, cut it off. Would \nyou just turn the dam thing off. He's obviously moving just pull everything over on \nwheels.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - Welcome to radio free America. America's ready, I'm ready. I \nwant a million voices crying out in the wilderness. Jesus let's get serious. Maybe Mr. \nWatts can shed some light no the mysterious disappearances of some of our students. \nLuis Chavez age fifteen, legally kicked out on September 26th. Arthur Washington age \nsixteen, expelled September 27th.\n\nCreswood - So what does this prove, not everyone goes to college.\n\nMurdock -Right.\n\nJan - Mr. Hunter I think you should be aware of something. After the school received the \nmoney from the government for every enrolled student, Mrs Creswood would then \nproceed to weed out those she felt were undesirable.\n\nCreswood - Nonsense she doesn't know what she's talking about.\n\nJan - In the first weeks you flagged all the pupils with low S.A.T. scores and started files \non them. Why?\n\nCreswood - What are you doing with school property?\n\nBrian - She asked you why.\n\nJan - For extra tutoring.\n\nBrian - You expelled over twenty students in the first thirty days of school.\n\nJan - And how many others did you harass into dropping out.\n\nBrian - And you kept the expelled students names on the rolls that's illegal.\n\nCreswood - The money went to the school, it was all for the good of the school.\n\nJan - Those kids had rights.\n\nCreswood - They were losers.\n\nMurdock - Trouble makers.\n\nDeaver - They're just kids.\n\nCreswood - I don't regret my policy.\n\nBrian - It's criminal and I'm suspending you.\n\nCreswood - You can't do that.\n\nBrian - Oh I'm afraid I just did.\n\n<Nora hits a bump trying to avoid the F.C.C. vans as she goes off road near the school \ngrounds>\n\nMark - Oh Jesus my harmoniser.\n\nNora - Forget it, hold on I've got to get us out off here.\n\nMark - I need that to disguise my voice.\n\nNora - Well give me a minute maybe we can fix it.\n\nMark - <Looks at the people gathered at the school> Jesus look at this. Fuck it, I'm going \non with out it.\n\nNora - No, I think I got it.\n\nMark - Okay this is really me now, no more hiding. Listen we're all worried, we're all in \npain, that just comes with having eyes with having ears, but just remember one thing it \ncan't get any worse, it can only get better. I mean high school is the bottom. Being a \nteenager sucks, but that's the point, surviving it is the whole point. Quitting is not going \nto make you strong, living will. So just hang on and hang in there.  You know I know all \nabout the hating and the sneering, I'm a member of the why bother generation myself. But \nwhy did I bother coming out here tonight and why did you? I mean it's time, it begins \nwith us not with politicians, the experts of the teachers, but with us, with you and with \nme, the ones who need it most. I believe with everything that's in me that the whole world \nis begging for healing, even the trees and the earth its self are crying out for it, you can \nhear it everywhere. It's the same kind of healing I desperately needed and finally feel has \nbegun with you.<A police chopper appears over head> Everyone mix it up, it's not game \nover yet, it's just the beginning, but it's up to you. I'm calling for every kid to seize the air. \nSteal it, it belongs to you. Speak out, they can't stop you. Find your voice and use it. Keep \nthis going. Pick a name, go on air. It's your life, take charge of it. Do it, try it, try \nanything. Spill your guts out and say shit and fuck a million times if you want to, but you \ndecide. Fill the air, steal it.
