Despite this, he tries to be supportive and helpful, as seen in his attempt to assist Nora. However, he also has moments of frustration and confusion, such as when he is unsure about what is happening or feels overwhelmed. On one occasion, he even expressed a desire to just give up and say \"\"What am I doing.

Despite this, she enjoys writing and appreciates Jan Emerson's teaching style. NORA also identifies as fearless and is trying to get Mark's message across. However, it appears that she has conflicting views on Happy Harry Hardon, as she initially agrees with his idea about thoughts being like viruses but later tries to stop him from talking about suicide.
