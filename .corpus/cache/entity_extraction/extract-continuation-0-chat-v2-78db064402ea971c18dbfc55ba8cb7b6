I never meant to hurt anyone, honestly I never meant to hurt anyone. I'm sorry \nMalcolm. I never said \"Don't do it\" I'm sorry. Erm anyway I'm done, stick a fork in me \nit's been grand. This is Happy Harry Hardon saying sionara, over and out.\n\nNora - Come on you can't do this.\n\nPaige - This is a joke right?\n\nMazz - C'mon Harry baby, don't stiff.\n\nMark - What am I doing. Fuck It!\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - You hear about some kid who did something stupid, something \ndesperate. What possessed him. How could he do such a terrible thing. It's really quite \nsimple actually. Consider the life of a teenager. You have parents, teachers telling you \nwhat to do. You have movies, magazines, and TV telling you what to do. But you know \nwhat you have to do. Your job, your purpose, is to get accepted, get a cute girl friend, and \nthink up something great to do with the rest of your life. What if you're confused and \ncan't imagine a career? What if you're funny looking and you can't get a girl friend? You \nsee no one wants to hear it, but the terrible secret is that being young is sometimes less \nfun than being dead.\n\nShep Sheppard - This is great he's making it worse.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - Suicide is wrong, but the interesting thing about it is how \nuncomplicated it seems. There you are, you got all these problems swarming around your \nbrain, and here is one simple, one incredibly simple solution. I'm just surprised it doesn't \nhappen every day around here. No now they're going to say I said offing yourself is \nsimple, but no, no, no, no, it's not simple. It's like everything else you have to read the \nfine print. For instance, assuming there is a heaven who would ever wanna go there, you \nknow. I mean think about it, sitting on this cloud, you know it's nice, it's quiet, there's no \nteachers, there's no parents, but guess what? There's nothing to do. Fucking boring. \nAnother thing to remember about suicide is that it is not a pretty picture. First of all, you \nshit your shorts you know. So there you are dead, people are weeping over you, crying, \ngirls you never spoke to are saying, \"Why? Why? Why?\" and you have a load in your \nshorts. That's the way I see it. Sue me. Now, they're saying I shouldn't think stuff like \nthis. They're saying something is wrong with me, that I should be ashamed. Well, I'm sick \nof being ashamed. Aren't you?\n\nNora - Sick to death!\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - I don't mind being dejected and rejected, but I'm not going to be \nashamed about it.\n\nNora - Alleuelya\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - At least pain is real. You look around and you see nothing is real, \nbut the pain is real. You know, even this show isn't real. This isn't me; I'm using a voice \ndisguiser. I'm a phoney fuck just like my Dad, just like anybody. You see, the real me is \njust as worried as the rest of you. They say I'm disturbed, well of course I'm disturbed. I \nmean we're all disturbed, and if we're not, why not? Doesn't this blend of blindness and \nblandness want to make you do something crazy? Then why not do something crazy? It \nmakes a hell of a lot of sense than blowing you fucking brains out you know. Go nuts, go \ncrazy, get creative! You got problems? You just chuck'em, nuke'em! They think you're \nmoody? Make'em think you're crazy, make'em think you might snap! They think you got \nattitude? You show'em some real attitude! Come on, go nuts, get crazy. Hey no more Mr. \nNice Guy. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, oh god!! ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, oh yes. <Paige throws \nall her stuff in the microwave and turns it on> <Henry Rollins plays> Time out! <Starts \nto read a letter> This is good, this is really very interesting.<Happy Harry Hardon dials \nthe phone>\n\nChris - Hello\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - Hi it's me you're on the air. Are you willing to tell my listeners \nwhat you told me here in this letter? Do you think they're ready to handle it.\n\nChris - I'm not ashamed.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - So tell us what happened.\n\nChris - This guy I knew, he invited me up to the ridge and I wasn't really sure why, but I \nwas really happy because he's a pretty cool guy, he's an athlete and everything.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - First of all where was this and how old are you.\n\nChris - It was just before school. I'm sixteen.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - Go ahead.\n\nChris - So we get up there, we take our shirts off and we start fooling around and then I \nsought of told him how much I liked him, he just smiled and said he knew it.
