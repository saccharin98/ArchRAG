I got my wild cherry diet Pepsi and I got \nmy Black Jack gum here and I got that feeling, mmm that familiar feeling that something \nrank is going down up there. Yeah, I can smell it. I can almost taste it. The rankness in \nthe air. It's everywhere. It's running through that old pipeline out there, trickling along the \ndumb concrete river and coming up the drains of those lovely tracktones we all live in. I \nmean I don't know. Everywhere I look it seems everything is sold out.\n\nAnnie - They say this is where the reception is the coolest.\n\nJohnathan - Then he'll probably live right around here.\n\nMazz - Fucking Yuppies.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - My dad sold out. And my mom sold out years ago when she had \nme. And then they sold me out when they brought me to this hole in the world. They \nmade me everything I am today so naturally I hate the bastards.
