I like that. Talk Hard. I like the idea that a voice can just go \nsomewhere uninvited and just kind of hang out like a dirty thought in a nice clean mind. \nTo me a thought is like a virus. You know, it can just kill all the healthy thoughts and just \ntake over. That would be serious.\n\nNora - That would be totally serious.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - I know all of my horny listeners would love it if I would call up \nthe eat me beat me lady. But no! Because she never encloses her number.\n\nNora - Tough look creepoid.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - Always the same red paper, the same beautiful black writing. \nShe's probably a lot like me, a legend in her own mind. But you know what, I bet in real \nlife she's probably not that wild. I bet she's kind of shy like so many of us who briskly \nwalk the halls, pretending to be late for some class, pretending to be distracted. Hey \npoetry lady, are you really this cool? Are you out there? Are you listening? \n\nNora - I'm always out here.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - I feel like I know you, and yet we'll never meet. Ah so be it... \nNow here's a song from my close personal buddies the Beastie Boys. A song that was so \ncontroversial they couldn't put it on their second album. What about a little night light.\n\n<Beastie Boys play>\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - I just love being the rap king of Arizona. I don't know drugs are \nout, sex is out, politics are out, everything is on hold. I mean we definitely need \nsomething knew. We just keep waiting for some new voice to come out of somewhere \nand say \"Hey wait a minute, what is wrong with this picture.\" <picks up a letter and \nopens it> Well maybe this is the answer to everything, wouldn't that be nice hey.  \"Dear \nHappy Harry Hardon do you think I should kill myself\" Great! Signed \"I'm Serious\" And \nof course there is a number here. <Calls the number> Hello serious?\n\nMalcolm - Yeah\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - Are you okay?\n\nMalcolm - Yep\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - I guess what I'm asking is how serious are you, well how are you \ngoing to do it?\n\nMalcolm - I'm gonna blow my fucking head off.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - O! Well do you have a gun.\n\nMalcolm - No I'm going to use my finger genius.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - Alright. So where is this gonna take place hey?\n\nMalcolm - Right here.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - Where is this alleged gun? Do you have it with you? Did you at \nleast write a note? You have a reason don't you? Your not going to be one of those people \nwho kills themselves and nobody has any idea of why they did it? Hey that's why we \nneed a note pal!\n\nMalcolm - I'm all alone.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - No, hey, maybe it's okay to be alone sometimes, everybody's \nalone.\n\nMalcolm - You're not.\n\nHappy Harry Hardon - I didn't talk to one person today, not..not counting teachers. I sit \nalone everyday you know, sitting on the stairwell eating my lunch, reading a book. What \nabout you?  <Malcolm hangs up> I hate that, now I'm depressed. Now I feel like killing \nmyself, but I'm too depressed to bother. <Tries to re-dial Malcolm, but it's engaged> \nGreat! He's got the phone of the hook. Rejected again, that's okay I'm use to it, terminal \nloneliness....... People always think they no who a person is but they're always wrong. \nMost parents have no idea. It's just that mine had me tested because I sit alone in my \nroom alone, naked, wearing only a cock ring, heh heh! I mean it really bugs me, everyone \nknows what a person should be, who cares who I should be! You know, in real life I \ncould be that anonymous nerd sitting across from you in Chem. Lab, staring at you so \nhard, you turn around, he tries to smile, but the smile just comes out all wrong. You just \nthink how pathetic, then he just looks away and never looks back at you again.
