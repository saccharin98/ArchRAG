As a teacher, he plays Happy Harry Hardon's tapes in class, bringing amusement to his students. In another context, Murdock is a person who agrees with something, indicating that he may be a supportive and conciliatory individual.\n\nHowever, there are also instances where Murdock warns students about the consequences of abusing privileges, such as dancing being taken away if misused.
